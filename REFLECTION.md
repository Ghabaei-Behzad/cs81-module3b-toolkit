1. What patterns or surprises did you notice?
I noticed that isOdd can simply be called !isEven to save code. But human readable is best.

2. What logic challenged your thinking?
Using the modulo operator % for parity was new to me, and also creating variables that were already declared. Using unique names for
variables or placing real values inside call, arguments.

3. How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
This toolkit could be used in a shopping cart to calculate totals or apply discounts. The functions look like simple calculator operations.
