The double(n) function will take a number n and multiply it by two. So 5 returns 10. yes prediction is correct.
The square(n) function will return the square of a number: such as 2 returns 4. yes prediction is correct.
The isEven(n) function returns true or false if number is even, with a modulo operation: returns no remainder. 4 is true, 5 is false. yes.
The isOdd(n) function will return true for 3 and false for 4. The modulo operator if the remainder is not ! a zero. yes prediction is correct.
The multiply(n) function will multiply two numbers a, b. yes prediction is correct.
The power(base, exponent) function uses Math.pow 2 ^3 is 8 . yes prediction is correct.
The powerOf(baseOf,exponentOf) function does not use Math. Yes it will be correct.
The fact(n) function will be correct 4! = 24, careful to use fact() instead of factorial().
