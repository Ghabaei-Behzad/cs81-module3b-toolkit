//Function 1: square a number
let n = 4; which will return 16
//Function 2: is a number even.
also n is 4 so true 
//Function 3: is the number odd
n is still 4 so false, i'ts not odd
//Function 4: multiply two numbers a, b
let a = 3;
let b = 4; The product will be 12.
//Function 5: double a number, if the number is 5 double is 10.
//Function 6: exponentiation
let base = 2;
let exponent = 3; 2 to the 3rd power is 8.
//Function 7: powerOf(0 function with (2,3) //-> 8
powerOf(base,exponent) was correct in finding the exponent. 2^3 is 8
//Function 8 fact(n) n is 4 fact() returns 24
//--//
the square of 4 is 16
the number 4 is even: true
the number 4 is odd: false
The numbers 3 * 4 = 12
Double 5: 10
The number 2 to the 3 power is: 8
8
factorial of 4 is: 24
