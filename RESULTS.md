//Function 1: square a number
let n = 4; which will return 16
//Function 2: is a number even.
also n is 4 so true 
//Function 3: is the number odd
n is still 4 so false, i'ts not odd
//Function 4: multiply two numbers a, b
let a = 3;
let b = 4; The product will be 12.
//Function 5: double a number, if the number is 5 double is 10.
//Function 6: exponentiation
let base = 2;
let exponent = 3; 2 to the 3rd power is 8.
